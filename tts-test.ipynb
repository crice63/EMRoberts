    "My Anaconda is -V 3.6.7, so can't use the `capture_output` parameter added to subprocess in 3.7. The `universal_newlines` parameter causes an encoding fault in subprocess somewhere, so I decode stdout manually after it returns. That is also why the rstrip() is needed, to remove the \\r\\n that eSpeak inserts. I don't know if decode removes the utf8 byte at the front of each line but it appears to."

    "So the above produces speech from my computer speaker (if the quiet flag, -q, is omitted), and has the unicode IPA output in a variable. I also found a program to syllabify the ipa forms. We should work line by line so that if espeak runs any words together or breaks the line into parts due to punctuation then we won't have to deal with it right away. We can get the line of poetry, get the IPA version, call them a line, and store it or print it. This partly depends on the front end desired on the Society webpage. Lets pause to get the Book into poems so we can run poems one at a time.\n",
