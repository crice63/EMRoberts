    "`fixUnder` is a script to take the poems from EMR *Under the Tree* and put each in its own file in the folder `/texts/UnderTree`. Initially I used Notepad++ to insert a code in front of each poem title (#) in the source file. I also had to delete the empty lines and title at the top of the source file, and fix a small number of poems that had a subtitle (\"A Song\"), that is now on the same line as the title. I also added a code (\\*\\*\\*) to mark the end of the file. \n",

    "Markup is entered based on the book's consistent internal structure. The inserted # triggers the end of the previous poem and the opening of a new poem with the next line. Then we can insert a header line, with poem count, <lg> tags with stanza counts, and <l> tags with a line count. (in TEI, <lg> stands for 'line group', a deliberately vague term to allow for local definitions.) The markup is TEI conformant, following the basic pattern at https://teibyexample.org/tutorials/TBED04v00.htm. I am looking into how to do the markup in JSON in case that is more versatile, or necessary for later processing.\n",
