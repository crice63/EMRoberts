    "`fixUnder` is a script to take the poems from EMR *Under the Tree* and put each in its own file in the folder `/texts/emr/UnderTree`. I hade used Notepad++ to insert a code in front of each poem title (#) in the source file. I also had to delete the empty lines and title at the top of the source file, and fix a small number of poems that had a subtitle (\"A Song\"), that is now on the same line as the title. \n",

    "5-25: New strategy: each poem is saved into a list and markup is entered based on the poem's consistent internal structure. I used the inserted # to trigger the end of the previous poem and the opening of a new list with the next line.  Once all the poems are marked up, we print them all at once. So now we can insert a header line, with poem count, <lg> tags with stanza counts, and <l> tags with a line count. The markup is TEI conformant, following the basic pattern at https://teibyexample.org/tutorials/TBED04v00.htm. I would like to figure out how to do the markup in JSON because that is more database-friendly, but this will do for now.\n",
