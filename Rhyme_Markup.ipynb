    "## Rhyme Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "ESpeak prepends two spaces--not sure what they are. One might be the BOM mark that then gets cleared by the decode statement. ESpeak introduces a line break to execute pauses in speech. We only need line endings for end-rhyme analysis. I removed all the other breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought that another way to go wih this whole deal would be to capture the output at a more advanced level. For MBROLA voices, eSpeak outputs detailed speech info for every segment, including intonation contours, but NOT syllable position. So I found a module that syllabifies English pretty well. Any internal rhyming that does not occur in a final syllable will have to be done by pure matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding rhymes is basically a matching exercise. For a first pass we can get the last X characters in each line into a list, then find any matches going forward. Since the poems in this book all utilize rhyme patterns by verse, I focused on getting rhymes from individual verses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I've noticed eSpeak doesn't use voiceless w, (turned w like \"which\" or \"whale\") and I'm sure EMR with a Chicago MA would have used that, so we might want to tweak the voice a bit. Note: eSpeak outputs double IPA characters for some signs, specifically affricates and diphthongs. They provide three workarounds:\n",
    "--ipa=1 Uses ties (U+0361) for phoneme names of more than one letter.\n",
    "--ipa=2 Uses Zero Width Joiner (U+200D) for phoneme names of more than one letter.\n",
    "--ipa=3 Separate phoneme names with underscore characters.\n",
    "Each one can be used by us but we just need to be consistent. It might be easiest to split words on underscores tp compare sounds, while just deleting underscores in order to print nice phonetics. I went with ipa=3.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as an arbitrary decision, let's see if we can make a single copy of each poem, marked up in very simple TEI, that includes the full orthographic and full IPA transliteration and labled rhyme scheme. If we have that we can easily get out static pages with different info, or come up with PHP or JavaScript methods of interactive display. To start this process I'm going back to the little program I made to separate the poems, and use that to insert some XML codes. Then we can use the XML to help process the rhyme schemes.\n"
