    "This is a compilation of two scripts, fixUnder and Rhyme_Markup. I put them together to see how long it would take to process the whole book (52 poems, about 30 seconds) and because checking a single file for errors is much easier than checking 52 files. I want to maintain the two different scripts for now because it will be easier to adapt them individually to other books and poets and to debug them separately. Dependencies are discussed in those scripts as well.  "
