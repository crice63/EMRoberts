    "## rhymeMarkup\n",
    "\n",
    "rhymeMarkup takes a single poem file with basic xml markup, detects the poem's rhyming lines, and adds information about them to the file: the phonetic rendering of each line, the rhyming syllable, its CV pattern, its characterization as strong or weak, and the rhyme label for each line in the familiar AB notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rhyme, for this first pass, is defined as matching rime segments in final syllables at a line's end. Finding rhymes is thus basically a matching exercise. We can get the last x characters in each line into a list, then find any matches going forward. Since the poems in this book all utilize rhyme patterns by verse, I focused on getting rhymes from individual verses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This routine has two significant dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**syllabify_ipa.py** is a module adapted from Kyle Gorman's syllabify (https://github.com/kylebgorman/syllabify). It takes the existing module, written for the CMU dictionary, and makes it work for the IPA transciptions that eSpeak produces. To allow our scripts to import syllabify_ipa, put it in the same folder as the EMR notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "CMU and eSPeak handle stress marking and rhotacized vowels differently. I have modified syllabify_ipa to remove stress markers when it looks for vowels in its list, but to retain them for other purposes. Currently rhymeMarkup removes stress markers after words have been syllabified, to ease the matching process. CMU indicates rhotic vowels by appending an r. ESpeak uses a handful of different IPA symbols, and an r on other vowels, so all these rhotic vowels must be added by hand to syllabify.  We won't know if the program is complete until we stop getting errors in syllabification due to missing vowels. They have slowed considerably.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Espeak** is a widely used text-to-speech engine. I chose it over the CMU dictionary used by most of these sorts of programs because as far as I know it is the only one available that has an option for IPA output, and it also makes guesses about transcriptions of unfamiliar words, neither of which the CMU model does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Espeak also allows for additions to its dictionary, so words it pronounces incorrectly can be overridden. The notebook Text-to-Speech, created as classroom instructional material, shows how to get eSpeak and install it. In the eSpeak/dictsource folder are files for translating each language, foe example, en_rules and en_list. For extending the Eglish dictionary we make a file called `en_extra`. To have it compiled with the other two files, use the command `espeak --compile=en` from the command line. Our copy of `en_extr`a is included here and we will continue to update it as needed. Currently the only entry is \"canyon.\" Entries have to be done in Arpabet. Rules for editing the \\_extra files are in section 4.4 Pronunciation Dictionary List of the eSpeak help files.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional notes about eSpeak: \n",
    "\n",
    "It prepends two spaces on output--not sure what they are. One might be the BOM mark that then gets cleared by the decode statement. ESpeak introduces a line break to execute pauses in speech ndicated by punctuation. We only need line endings for end-rhyme analysis. I remove all the other breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought that another way to go with this whole deal would be to capture the output at a more advanced level. For MBROLA voices, eSpeak outputs detailed speech info for every segment, including intonation contours, but NOT syllable position. I am certain eSpeak creates and uses syllabification in its process because dictionary entries can include references to syllables by index (syl[0], syl[1], etc.). I just don't know how to get that info out of eSpeak. Ideally I would use an eSpeak API instead of running it externally on every line. There is one out there, built only for \\*nix systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've noticed eSpeak doesn't use voiceless w, (turned w like \"which\" or \"whale\") and I'm sure EMR with a Chicago MA would have used that, so we might want to tweak the voice a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "eSpeak outputs double IPA characters for some signs, specifically affricates and diphthongs. They provide three workarounds:\n",
    "--ipa=1 Uses ties (U+0361) for phoneme names of more than one letter.\n",
    "--ipa=2 Uses Zero Width Joiner (U+200D) for phoneme names of more than one letter.\n",
    "--ipa=3 Separate phoneme names with underscore characters.\n",
    "Each one can be used by us but we just need to be consistent. I decided to split words on underscores to compare sounds, while just deleting underscores in order to print nice phonetics. I went with ipa=3.\n"
